The market is expected to reach nearly $23 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 7-8%. As more consumers prioritize convenience and sustainability, laundry pods are likely to dominate the laundry care category. Furthermore, manufacturers are expected to leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enhance the functionality of laundry pods and their packaging.</p><p>Overall, while the period between 2018 and 2022 laid the foundation for the laundry pods market's rapid expansion, the next decade will be marked by sustainability, innovation, and an increasingly globalized market.
